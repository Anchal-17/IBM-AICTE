# üõ†Ô∏è Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery using IBM AutoAI

This project uses IBM Watson's AutoAI to build a machine learning model that predicts machinery failure types based on real-time sensor data. The system helps industrial units implement proactive maintenance strategies to reduce downtime and optimize performance.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Predict the type of failure (e.g., Tool Wear, Heat Dissipation) using sensor data.
- **Solution**: Use IBM AutoAI to automatically train, optimize, and deploy a classification model.
- **Outcome**: High-accuracy model deployed via IBM Watson Machine Learning with REST API support.
